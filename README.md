# Electric Ducted Fan Thrust Vectoring Control System

## Project Overview

This repository contains the Arduino control code and data acquisition system for my graduate research project focused on developing novel thrust vectoring capabilities for Electric Ducted Fans (EDFs). The project aims to integrate two custom thrust vectoring EDFs onto a UAV airframe to enable Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) operations.

## Research Context

This work is part of a larger research initiative to advance electric propulsion systems for next-generation aircraft. The project addresses the critical need for versatile, efficient thrust vectoring solutions in both military UAV applications (like enhanced MQ-1C Gray Eagle capabilities) and civilian eVTOL markets (similar to the Lilium Jet architecture).

## Data Analysis

### Polynomial Thrust Model

Our thrust prediction model uses a second-order polynomial with exponential weighting:

```latex
F_{thrust} = a_0 + a_1 \cdot P + a_2 \cdot P^2 + a_3 \cdot \theta + a_4 \cdot \theta^2 + a_5 \cdot P \cdot \theta
```

Where:
- F_{thrust} = Generated thrust force (N)
- P = PWM pulse width (Î¼s)
- Î¸ = Flap deflection angle (degrees)
